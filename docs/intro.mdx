# Weaviate

<Badges></Badges>

Welcome to the Weaviate documentation. Here you will find what Weaviate is all about, how to create your Weaviate instance, interact with it, and use it to perform vector searches and classification.

Like what you see? Consider giving us a ⭐ on [Github](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/stargazers).

## What is Weaviate?

#### Weaviate in a nutshell:

* Weaviate is an open source ​database of the type ​vector search engine.

* Weaviate allows you to store JSON documents in a class property-like fashion while attaching machine learning vectors to these documents to represent them in vector space.

* Weaviate can be used stand-alone (aka bring your vectors), with a wide variety of modules that can do the vectorization for you or extend the core capabilities.

* Weaviate has a GraphQL-API to access your data easily.

* ​We aim to bring your vector search set up to production to query in mere milliseconds (check our [open source benchmarks](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/benchmarks/) to see if Weaviate fits your use case).

* Get to know Weaviate in the [basics getting started guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/core-knowledge/basics.html) in under five minutes.

#### Weaviate in detail: 

Weaviate is a low-latency vector search engine with out-of-the-box support for different media types (text, images, etc.). It offers Semantic Search, Question-Answer Extraction, Classification, Customizable Models (PyTorch/TensorFlow/Keras), etc. Built from scratch in Go, Weaviate stores both objects and vectors, allowing for combining vector search with structured filtering and the fault-tolerance of a cloud-native database, all accessible through GraphQL, REST, and various programming languages client.

## Weaviate helps

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
