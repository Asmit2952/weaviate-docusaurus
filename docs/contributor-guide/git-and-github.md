## Installing git 

The most widely used version control system is Git. Git keeps track of the changes you make to files, allowing you to go back to previous versions if necessary and keeping a record of what has been done. Git can be used locally, but in order to preserve your work or collaborate with other team members, you must push your work to a remote repository.

You need to install Git on your computer before you can use it. If it's already installed, updating to the most recent version is probably a good idea. Read more about **installing git** [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
